While comedic scripts are my first love, I am equally adept at dramas that have some comedic heart in them. Life is too short...why not spend some time laughing? As an actor, I have been compared to Melissa McCarthy, Sara Rue, Merritt Weaver, and Tina Fey.

?Originally from Northern Virginia right outside Washington, DC, I have a BA in Theater from the University of Mary Washington. My one-person shows, Confessions of an Invisible Woman and Butter: a love story premiered at the Capital Fringe Festival to sold out shows and great reviews. I co-founded, write and perform with my sketch comedy group, Curvy by Nature.

When not performing or writing, I can be found cuddling with my cat, Harlem, or cooing at kittens in various Petco's around the city.

She was introduced to the piano at the age of six, and developed her understanding of storytelling and performance through musical vocational school.  It wasn't until Jackie returned to her birth state to attend the music theatre program at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts that she discovered her true calling.  

""When everyone else was memorizing lines to songs and stories, I was writing my own stories through song, belting out the tunes of Etta James, Duffy, and Regina Spektor along the way.""  

Always an avid reader of poetry, she found herself delving deeply into the works of Leonard Cohen and Fiona Apple, entranced by the precision and mystery of their word choice.  As an artist, Ms. Paladino seeks to combine this sense of lyric perfectionism and her urgency to ""mold the ugly into something beautiful"" along with the power and soul of her favorite songstresses.  

Jackie is a Bloomworld Music Artist and is managed by Hakim Bell.  She has recently worked with vocal coach Don Lawrence (Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera), producers Chris Griffin (Madonna, John Legend), Grammy nominated producer Ivan Corraliza (Timbaland, Christina Aguilera), and Grammy award winning producer Tyrone Corbett.  Currently residing in Brooklyn, you can catch Jackie performing regularly in the tri-state area at venues such as BBKings, World Cafe Live, Rockwood Music Hall, The Bowery Electric, and The Bitter End, amongst others.

My name is Genevieve Deely.  I am a wife, a mother, an actress and a soap-maker.  When I am not running around with my toddler or making soap, I am usually in acting class. Acting is passion I discovered later in life and I could not be more excited to be on this journey.  As I build a reel, I am interested in Student Films and plays. I have completed over 18 months of scene study and on-camera intensives and continue to attend weekly classes. I couldn't imagine life with them now!

I studied Electrical and Computer Systems engineering with a minor in Theater and Business at Umass Amherst and worked that corporate life until 2015 when I decided I wanted to pursue acting and filmmaking full time. I worked in Boston as a PA, assistant director, actress, tech and sound, model - anything and everything I could get my hands on to learn more about every aspect of this business. I worked for a fortune 500 company and was set to be lead of the quality engineering department - except I wanted more. 

After moving, I have been fortunate to work with some fantastic people. I am now the assistant director for the off broadway play, Muslim in the Midst, working remotely as a software developer, producer and anchor for Spotlife Asia and commercial actress as I take classes and learn more about TV and Film.

I'm madly in love with life, people, animals and the sacred art of acting.  I've wanted to be an actress for as long as I can remember, and finally mustered the courage to go after my dream in 2011.  I have to pinch myself a lot because I've been so beyond blessed with all of the wonderful training and opportunities I've been given over the past five years.  When I was a young girl I saw Meryl Streep's riveting performance in ""Sophie's Choice"", and it shook me to the core.  At that moment I knew I wanted to become an actress so I could hopefully cause others to be as moved as I was after watching that notorious scene where she made the unimaginable decision.  I feel that when I'm cast in a role it's my utmost responsibility to tell the characters story as they were  created from the authors heart and most likely based on their own experiences or an individual they know or knew. With each performance I give I make it an absolute goal for my viewers to walk away with a better understanding of human nature.

I would love to be involved in as many performance opportunities as possible! 

I mostly have theatre experience but as a career I want to do film so I absolutely want to start exploring those opportunities. 

I am open to any print or commercial opportunities and have more professional photos if that is needed for any possible casting opportunities! 

The only directing experience I have is with short plays and One Acts, but if any student films need assistants or just extra help I would love to lend a hand for that too! 

Side note! I am very familiar with Final Cut Pro and iMovie so if that would ever come in hand, now you know!

Over all I promise I am a really nice person who would honestly be excited to work on any project! Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!

As a recent graduate of NYU Tisch School of the Arts Keziah earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Acting – Musical Theater, minoring in Africana Studies.
?
      Originally from Washington DC, Keziah has been studying the arts since the age of four. Some of her artistic training includes: Studio Theater, Jones Haywood School of Dance, Interlochen Arts Academy, NYU Tisch, University of Ghana, and Duke Ellington School of the Arts. She has performed in many roles throughout the theater and musical theater cannon with her most influential including Kate in Michael John’s LaChiua’s The Wild Party, The DJ in Will Power’s The Seven, Hecuba in Euripides’ The Trojan Women and Nabalungi in The Book of Mormon. As a Film, TV, and stage actress Keziah seeks work and collaborators that express an interest in the pan African experience as well as work and collaborators inspired by the stories of peoples who may not have a platform to speak their voice and share their truth. 
     
      On her path of revolution by way of art Keziah began writing and producing her own music in high school, while attending the Duke Ellington School of the Arts - creating melodies, harmonies, and lyrics, going by her middle name, Niambi, which means Melody in Swahili. Niambi masterfully moves between the genres of soul, funk, Jazz and Hip-Hop as she delivers a uniquely distinctive musical experience. Her musical influences range from legends, such as Ella Fitzgerald, Lauryn Hill, Chaka Khan, Prince, Erykah Badu, Bob Marley and A Tribe Called Quest.
     
      Keziah also has experience as a teaching artist, exposing inner city youth in D.C. to Hip-Hop/Poetry and songwriting. In her work as a thespian, songwriter, MC, and healer Keziah Niambi is dedicated to connecting people throughout the world by creating art that ables us to see ourselves in one another, awakening solidarity and growth amongst our global community.
     
      As Keziah works to fulfill her purpose in this lifetime she sees herself as a spiritual being having a human experience. She plans to share some of this experience in an album she's currently composing entitled StellarNebula. Along with working on her debut album,  Keziah Niambi is currently an understudy and swing in The Book of Mormon on Broadway. Keziah wishes her readers and listeners love, light, and great health!",<a href='http://www.weebly.com/editor/uploads/5/2/9/2/52921565/715645166534812181_keziah_new_resume_edit_10-3_1.pdf' target='_blank'>keziah_new_resume_edit_10-3_1.pdf</a>,<a href='http://www.weebly.com/editor/uploads/5/2/9/2/52921565/987489693977268188_img_0028_9950_2.jpg' target='_blank'>img_0028_9950_2.jpg</a>,,,

I am currently studying Acting at NYU's and Tisch School of the Art's Stonestreet Screen Acting Studios. 
My previous NYU studio training includes 2 years at Playwrights Horizons Theatre School where I was educated in acting, directing, design, movement, music, and scene work, a semester at the Experimental Theatre Wing where I focused on Grotowski technique, and a semester at NYU's Program at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, in which I was educated in nearly every facet of Shakespearean performance. The curriculum included: acting, text-based work, broadsword, clowning, movement, period dance, and singing. Once I returned to the states under the direction of Rosemary Quinn, Andy Arden Reese, and Daniel Spector, I continued with my Grotowski work at the Experimental Theatre Wing. This past semester, I also studied dance/movement composition, Afro-Haitian Dance, and voiceover technique with Ilyana Kadushin. 
I had the pleasure of interning at the Irish Repertory Theater Company in New York two summers ago, and I studied Acting in Musical Theatre at Guildhall School of Music & Drama in London two summers ago. I'm interested in Theatre for Young Audiences, Theatre Therapy, and Theatre Education as well as stagecraft. ",,,,,
