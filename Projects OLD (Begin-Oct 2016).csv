Samuel is a 25 year old filled with anxiety. He wants to be a comedian but the moment he steps on the stage he isn’t funny. He hates to drink and pop pills but does it all the time anyway. He has confused feelings for his stepfather and frustration with his mother. He cares about other people but doesn’t know how to show it. He is insecure, and takes it out on others. He knows Carly (girlfriend) like the back of her hand. They spend a lot of time together even though they bicker for most of it. 
Saul (35-45) is a very strongly opinionated man in a bubble. He is a good comedian but steals most of his material. He dreams of being a great comedian and believes Hannah can get him there. People love him so his ego is at an all time high. He loves his somewhat new wife but is open to anything really. If he were aware of himself he would be very insecure. 

Hannah (45-55) has business in her blood. She’s on top of everything all the time except when it comes to her sons feelings. She loves to micro manage everyone around her and is very confident and will say whatever is on her mind. It’s her way or the high way. If she didn’t have such cheap parents she would have gone to an Ivy League school, and became a politician or Warren Buffet.

","It follows a young comedian named Samuel on a night of gigs. He has a secret that will change his life and that secret is he is in love with his stepfather, Saul. The only problem is he has a girlfriend and a mother for a manager.","November 19th through the 23rd","jakahn180@gmail.com"

","Set in the near future, America's Game can be simply described as this: take the Wolf of Wall street and mix it with College football, and add a sprinkle of Goodfellas. However, in this world, college football doesn't exist and is replaced by Gladiator (exactly what it you think it is). Over the years, Gladiator has become a relatively safe sport thanks to futuristic suits that protect athletes. The film follows a freshman, who abandons his passion for writing screenplays and creating film for taking the easy way out to a seemingly more glorious life of sex, alcohol, money and parties. As he builds his empire upon an innovative steroid, he learns true love and that he  has face the music in controlling his ""empire of lions."" This movie is a dark, comedic, horrific, and painful  satire of the controversy behind college sports, steroid culture, letting players get away with rape and murder, and how schools use their athletes as cash cows. This is also takes a deeper look at the idea of playing America's Game; cutthroat tactics, using others, following the crowd, sex, money, power, greed and sacrificing who you are in order to fit in, all disguised as a roller coaster ride of a movie.

In a world where the color palate is literally limited to black, white, and grey,  color has been deemed “attention seeking” and “chaotic”. Vibrants, those who are born with a genetic condition that spreads color throughout their bodies and makes them uncontrollably drawn to all things colorful, are forced to hide who they are. Anyone who reveals him or herself is faced with passionate rejection from Greytown’s citizens. 
 This is the story of Jane, a color collector. Like her father before her, Jane’s job is to confiscate all colorful objects. But when she is the first to use her co-worker's newly designed time machine, she is forced to face herself—in the past.  Anxiety ensues, and it is revealed what she is hiding and what the consequences are for facing that truth.  It could change the state of her identity—and her world—forever.

Mother: (Lead) MOTHER [GENDER: FEMALE] [AGE: 20-40]
Mother is our protagonist and narrator. She has been living for years on a dystopian world where food has become more and more scarce. She has gotten by comfortably as the wife of the Headman (the leader of her village and care taker) but has suffered watching other children go hungry and dealing with the pain of eating her own, unhealthy child. When we first meet her, she is running for her life. How did she get here and who is chasing her? 

Marn: (Supporting) MARN [GENDER: MALE] [AGE: 25-40]
Marn is the Mother's first husband, father of her child and Headman.It is implied that he takes very good care of his wife, children, and those who depend on him but also has a temper. 

Tischy: (Supporting) TISCHY [GENDER: MALE] [AGE: 25-35]
Tischy is the second Headmaster, the Mother's second husband and Marn's murderer. He's described as seemingly lazy but surprisingly quick and lively when it comes to him becoming the leader. 

Neely: (Supporting) NEELY [GENDER: MALE] [AGE: 18-25]
Neely is Mother and Marn's son. He has grown up to be strong (having eaten comfortably and gotten strength from ""Daddy Porridge"") and with the ideas of a leader firmly rooted in him. He is the one who not only has stolen the title of Headmaster from Tischy, but is now on the hunt for someone much closer to him.

Brooklyn’s vast diversity is often separated by attitude.  Alexandra Moss is a successful black Architect living in Park slope.  Ogden, her husband, from whom she has been separated for seven years is a NYC detective believing in segregation, living in a black area.   Angel is like his father promulgating prejudice and running away into booze and drugs and David lives in his intellectual dream, now raising his son after his wife leaves him for a woman.  Angelo, white, gay, visits from Rome after the death of his husband. Alexandra, though sexually drawn to Ogden, finds herself wanting Angelo. Can love and intimacy override sexual preference?  Can differences be overlooked for passion?   Have things really evolved or are our masks better? David and Angel are both suddenly forced to see beyond their bubbles, about to burst.","Rehearsal: Feb 17-19, 22-24 10am-1:15 (Some flexibility. Times subject to change.

In Rock and a Hard place, Jack is stuck between his love for Sara and his passion for Rock’N’Roll and has to make a choice. The action takes place during a single crazy night. Through this movie, by using the laugh and the fun, I want to show how hard it is for young people to make their dream come true without hurting the friends they love. I’ve been a professional musician and that helped me to make this story as authentic as it could. I will use the visual and sound atmosphere of the city of New York because it has some kind of its own music. « Rock and a Hard Place » is playful and fun. The strong relationships of the characters are building a deep and authentic background. This film is between the hilarious farce and the black comedy. The frenetic suspense will beat this tremendous trip under acid.

Filmmaker Joyce Mishaan sets out to make a hybrid documentary/comedy about the ongoing Israeli occupation in the West Bank, using the Marx Brother’s DUCK SOUP as her material. As her ambitious plan falls to pieces with each attempt to move the project forward, and up against forces of war, distance, family, identity, and practicality, she finds that the biggest obstacle is her own ambiguity. Without quite a film to show for her efforts, she begs the question - how can you resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict if you can’t even resolve to make a film about it?

Taking on the non-sectarian spiritual traditions as a starting point, the piece invites the audience to look inside themselves and accept their flaws, virtues and instincts.

The audience engages in the story by partially controlling the lights. When entering the room, the public receive instructions to wear headsets with a flashlight attached, causing an initial discomfort on interactions. A semi-reflective wall hides the stage and suggests them to look at themselves first. Once the show starts, the stage is solely lighted by users’ flashlights. They will find the character struggling for survival, threatened by their presence. 

A set of suspended light rings will come down and “dance” around the performer, shining on his hyper reflective husk. These lights are the key for his recovery, if he let go his vanity. 

I'm an ITP student and I'm looking for a dancer mostly, but also a music composer. Don't hesitate to reach out (Phone: 917 971 3108), share your reel and portfolio. I will be happy to share the mockups and stage design for this piece.  More info about me : www.hiedson.com

RAY - Male, Puerto Rican. A charismatic leader with a strong, “Type-A” personality. He is like a Big brother to DJ. His loyalty is to people not principle. Ray has vision. He is an idea man.

DARREL (21 - Lead) is deeply attached to his past and fears that passage of time is going to distance him from it. He’s a fun loving musician going through all the uncertainty and challenges of young adulthood. Darrel is quirky and painfully self-aware. He tries to hide his sensitivity by playing the stoner/smart ass role in his group.

SONIA (22, Indian descent) is a smart, kind, college graduate who is about to go to grad school. She enjoys spending time with the characters of this story because they’re among the few people with whom she doesn’t fear judgement or a need to prove herself. Because of this, she supports and looks after them like an older sister. She also has a very thick skin for all their teasing. 

ABDUL (21, Middle-Eastern/South Asian descent) is the youngest of an accomplished family. His older brother is on his way to becoming a doctor, and his parents have always wished the same for him. Abdul however, has just failed the MCAT and been expelled from a 6 year direct med program. In his mind he’s failed at being what he should be and is thrown into an existential crisis. While in this state, he decides to ignore his childhood friends while home for the summer.

OTTER (21) is charming, arrogant, and in control. He’s good at manipulating circumstances whether social or vocational to his liking. He’s aloof to the changing nature of life and chooses instead to focus on the moment. When faced with a situation that is out of his control (Abdul ignoring him), Otter doesn’t know how to respond and views it as his own failure. This mentality makes him a fierce friend. 

CLARA (20) still has a lot of college ahead of her and doesn’t feel the imposing pressure of life like the other characters. However, she still feels lost. She’s trying to find herself and trusts her strong intuition to guide her. ","Still Grove is about returning home and the gradual realization that it might not be where one belongs. The film follows college student Darrel through a series of events on his last day of summer as he tries to stay connected with his past. These include a graduation party, coffee with an ex, trying to help a distraught friend by breaking into his house, etc. In doing so, Darrel and company face the reality that while relationships and locations might appear deceptively the same, everything has become distant and different as they've grown.","April 21st-25th ","stillgrovefilm@gmail.com"

Auditions are Friday March 4th from 2-6pm and Saturday, March 5th from 11am-3pm. 

Additional auditions may be held  the weekend of March 12th. ","Lam is a dark coming-of-age comedy. Owen and his older brother Riley are spoiled brats living in upper-class Connecticut. After the boys accidentally kill their friend in a game of human darts, their tiger-mom Ginny hides them out in the woods to evade the police. There, she continues coddling her two boys. Riley is a blissful ignoramus, and like Ginny, he has no idea what the severity of their situation is. Owen, however, is beginning to realize that a life of pampering will only make him weaker, and plans to escape his mother's control. 

Character Descriptions: 

Owen Shepherd (17) - Owen is on the cusp of adulthood. Despite growing up with his mother’s pamperful parenting, Owen is beginning to realize his spoiled lifestyle restrains his ability to take action in his own life. He is displeased with the quality of food and shelter Ginny provides, which triggers his desire to leave the hideout. Owen isn’t a genius (he was dumb enough to play human darts and kill a guy), but he’s a contemplative realist when given the time to think. 

Riley Shepherd (21) - Riley is a foil to Owen. He’s ignorant, debaucherous, and binges on booze and junkfood while they’re in hiding. He has no idea how much trouble he and Owen are in, and relies on his mother to figure out what happens next. Riley is a college drop-out who has completely given in to his mother’s coddling. He dons topsiders, salmon shorts, and a Vineyard Vines vest.

You will also have the option to edit, though this is not a requirement. No paid compensation, but costs will be covered while on the job (food, lodging, transportation).

Must have your own camera and sound equipment (the more portable, the better; think DSLR and a Zoom recorder), and be familiar with running both simultaneously.

Please send a resume, brief cover letter explaining interest in the project, and a short reel or a link to a previous film. ","About the Summer Bike Adventure: 
Cyclists who take part in the Summer Ride will bike across the nation for nine weeks, beginning in Seattle, WA and ending in Washington DC. Along the way, the participants assist in the construction and repair of homes for low-income families. The film should encapsulate the need for affordable housing, and the specific personal stories encountered on the way across the country. The main characters will be the individuals and families that are given a hand-up through the Fuller Center's ministry of partnership housing. In addition to directing the short documentary throughout the summer, the director will be in charge of overseeing the output of shorter, more frequent media that serve to promote the Bike Adventure's mission to a larger audience. 

Logistics:
While food, housing and transportation will be covered when on the job, you will have to make your own way to Seattle/from DC . This project is best suited for a student or recent graduate who is passionate about socially-conscious documentaries, wishes to gain experience, and wants the cross-country adventure of a lifetime!

DARREL (21 - Lead) is deeply attached to his past and fears that passage of time is going to distance him from it. He’s a fun loving musician going through all the uncertainty and challenges of young adulthood. Darrel is quirky and painfully self-aware. He tries to hide his sensitivity by playing the stoner/smart ass role in his group.

SONIA (22) is a smart, kind, college graduate who is about to go to grad school. She enjoys spending time with the characters of this story because they’re among the few people with whom she doesn’t fear judgement or a need to prove herself. Because of this, she supports and looks after them like an older sister. She also has a very thick skin for all their teasing. 

ABDUL (21, Middle-Eastern/South Asian descent) is the youngest of an accomplished family. His older brother is on his way to becoming a doctor, and his parents have always wished the same for him. Abdul however, has just failed the MCAT and been expelled from a 6 year direct med program. In his mind he’s failed at being what he should be and is thrown into an existential crisis. While in this state, he decides to ignore his childhood friends while home for the summer.

OTTER (21) is charming, arrogant, and in control. He’s good at manipulating circumstances whether social or vocational to his liking. He’s aloof to the changing nature of life and chooses instead to focus on the moment. When faced with a situation that is out of his control (Abdul ignoring him), Otter doesn’t know how to respond and views it as his own failure. This mentality makes him a fierce friend. 

CLARA (20) still has a lot of college ahead of her and doesn’t feel the imposing pressure of life like the other characters. However, she still feels lost. She’s trying to find herself and trusts her strong intuition to guide her. ","Still Grove is about returning home and the gradual realization that it might not be where one belongs. The film follows college student Darrel through a series of events on his last day of summer as he tries to stay connected with his past. These include a graduation party, coffee with an ex, trying to help a distraught friend by breaking into his house, etc. In doing so, Darrel and company face the reality that while relationships and locations might appear deceptively the same, everything has become distant and different as they've grown.","APril 20-24th","stillgrovefilm@gmail.com"

","LAPSE  follows Paul Campbell, a recent high school graduate, in the wake of the drug-fueled suicide of his best friend, Nathan Parker. When Paul leaves community college to finally return to his hometown of Emerald Valley, CA, his reception is startlingly cold, and it becomes clear that the community at large, including many of Paul’s former friends and their families, blame Paul for Nathan’s death.  Lapse is a post-tragedy narrative—a story about blame set in a world of twisted suburban values that examines the desperate defenses and prejudices of the human heart.

My name is Ashleigh Hill and this past year I created StyleBone Designs, a startup online site. We primarily focus in areas of fashion styling, apparel design, mixed media art, and photography. Each month we present our collection. The collection consists of a 48x60 canvas, first painted then a mixed media element is added. (Past collections: bones felt like bones, 45 records on the canvas, exc.) My team then styles models using the canvas and art, uniting the two through a camera lens. Along with a behind the scenes, the creative process in time lapse videos (For example: will have a videographer capturing behind the scenes and more during the photoshoot). 
 
The editorial makeup/hair artistry is very important regarding the uniform/artistic side of StyleBone, which will be discussed in further detail regarding responses. (Mood board examples, overall theme) The shoot dates for our August Collection are Saturday July 23rd & Sunday July 24th. Items relevant to makeup/hair can be purchased under StyleBone, if notice of the items wanted is given early enough. (Eyelashes & a wide variety shadow pallet can be provided and so forth relating to the mood boards) 
 
We have worked with various/unique make up and hair artists in past collections, collaborating with all types of people. Our shoot will create content for the artist's social media feeds as well as his/her name being credited throughout the site and all our social media outlets (Instagram, Snapchat, and the video), creating great exposure for them as a makeup/hair artist. Including their own page designated to their process of makeup/hair artistry. 

In addition to all above there will be food, drinks, and entertainment through out the shoot. 
 
Look forward to hearing back!

Three Acting Roles: 

Caleb Kring

a reclusive, artistic, and a bit OCD; hangs on the fringes of social acceptance; one last quirk: he can enter the dreams of the most popular girl in school.

Macy Maven

the girl you wish you were in high school; pretty, popular, and perfect, to a fault; an incredible ballerina, but this is all just a facade to fit in, something that gets particularly difficult when a kid from her school starts poking around her dreams.

Joey Donovan 

on the surface, he's a teenage, jockey, frat guy in training; boyfriend of Macy, the most popular girl in school, but there's a bit more to it than that; Joey fights to protect the status quo when Macy's stalker, Caleb, starts getting too close.

[ANTON] (late 20’s/early 30’s): He’s clever. Charming. Witty. Intelligent... although sometimes less so than he thinks himself to be. He’s seeking love, but is often torn between looking cool and saying what he really feels. At the worst moments, he is led around by the leash of his ego.

[JILL] (late 20’s/early 30’s): She’s relaxed. Chilled out. Funny. Wise beyond her years. Looks can be deceiving though; underneath the warmth lies a cutting edge if you want to feel it. Jill wants a companion. A partner. She’s been in the NYC dating scene for a bit and doesn’t have time for jokers.","Short Film

Casting session date: TBD: 9/17/16 or 9/24/16
Shoot location: Downtown Manhattan
Shoot length: 2 nights
Shoot dates: TBD: 1st or 2nd October weekend

SYNOPSIS:

It’s Jill and Anton’s first date. They met online. Like many New Yorkers, they are lonely. Things are going well. Really well - that is, until Jill asks Anton what his astrological sign is. It’s a load of irrational bullshit, he says. How exactly can you know that, she says. Things get worse from there - and personal. Way too personal.

Jill calls Anton on his bullshit: arguing a point, just to make other people feel stupid. She cuts deep. Maybe deep enough that he’ll finally recognize his self-destructive pattern?

This could be a big night for both of them.

A NOTE FROM THE FILMMAKER: Alexander Christenson / thinkmad.com

I am a writer, director, editor, cinematographer of features, commercials, documentaries, and music videos. My work has been featured on NBC, Vice, MTV, & Complex. This is a passion project for me - and I am very excited about it. This film lives and dies on the faces of my actors, and I intend to collaborate in great detail with them. Think of the most intense scene in “Louie” or of the Smith’s song “I Know It’s Over” and you’ll grasp where I’m taking this. I will happily share the script upon request.","TBD: 1st or 2nd October weekend","thinkmadcasting@gmail.com"
